# Flutter BAN Anomaly Detection App

This repository showcases a Flutter application for Body Area Network (BAN) anomaly detection. It integrates a machine learning model to analyze real-time heart rate and body temperature data, potentially flagging health concerns.

**Key Features:**

* **Real-time Sensor Data Monitoring:** Track vital signs from connected BAN devices.
* **AI-powered Anomaly Detection:** Leverage a pre-trained model ([https://github.com/Kunal70616c/Body-Network-Area](https://github.com/Kunal70616c/Body-Network-Area)) to identify potential health risks.
* **User-friendly Interface:** View sensor data and receive alerts in a clear and concise manner.

This project demonstrates the potential of Flutter for developing health-focused mobile applications and the power of machine learning in preventative healthcare.
